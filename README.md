# Aye-Alfred
AI powered assistant that makes scheduling meetings easier

Aye ‘Alfred can be fully integrated into your corporate calendar
tool of choice.

Simply instruct him to schedule a meeting or a call with a colleague
or a team via email, voice or over chat.

Each member of the corporate has got his/her own “Aye ‘Alfred” butler bot who has access to their calendar and knows his/her preferences. 

Aye ‘Alfred automatically schedules for a meeting without anyone’s manual intervention.

It does this by negotiating with the other “Aye ‘Alfred” butler bots of the invitees.

Since each of the “Aye ‘Alfred” butler bot knows their master’s preferences and availability, negotiation is automated and a meeting is scheduled which is mutually convenient and at an appropriate time.
